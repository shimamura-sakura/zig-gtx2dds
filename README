convert between Gust GTX (.gtx) and DDS (.dds)
currently it only supports UBC1 (DXT1) and UBC3 (DXT5), but i guess it's enough.

-----
./build.sh

usage
-----
./main <input file> <output file>

gtx file format
---------------
please read 'main.zig' and 'gtx_test.zig'.
gtx_test.zig checks a gtx file against my understandings of the gtx format, compile it with debug on to see code trace (where your file wents wrong, if you are also generating gtx files).

thank you @nebulas-star for helping me with this file format
